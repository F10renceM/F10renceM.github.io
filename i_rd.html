        <h4>Matilda</h4>
        <p>Matilda tells the tale of Matilda, a good five-year-old girl who loves to read, has a horrible family and an even worse headmistress… She soon discovers, however, that she is special, and can make things move with her eyes. This is fundamentally a tale of good versus evil, but no topic, no matter how many times it has been told before, is boring when it is written by Roald Dahl. His imagination, creativeness and inventiveness make this children’s story one-of-a-kind, and it will stay with you for years after you read it.</p>

        <h4>The Witches</h4>
        <p>An orphaned boy is sent to Norway to live with his grandmother, who warns him to be wary of witches, but when they travel to England together it just so happens that they stumble upon a witch convention! English witches are the most evil of all: horrible hags disguised as normal women who plot to exterminate England’s children by turning them into mice could sound like pure madness — or a very traumatising read for young children — but rest assured, The Witches is one of the funniest, most entertaining books by Roald Dahl and is certainly worth reading.</p>

      <li>
        <img src= "q_rd3.jpg" alt= "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory">
        <h4>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</h4>
        <p>Many of us are already familiar with Willie Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, but if you have not yet read this book — possibly Dahl’s most famous one – you are in for a treat. Readers are immersed in a world filled with descriptions of the most delicious foods you can imagine (but also of hilarious characters), making Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a book that appeals to all ages, and senses! If you have a sweet tooth, take precautions and do not read this on an empty stomach!</p>

      <li>
        <img src= "q_rd4.jpg" alt= "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator">
        <h4>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</h4>
        <p>Less known but equally enthralling, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator allows the reader to continue to accompany Charlie and Willie Wonka on their exciting adventures: this time they accidentally travel to outer space and just when they are about to land on a luxury space hotel built by the US, the ‘Vermicious Knids’ appear (evil aliens who like to eat humans). The sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is emblematic of Roald Dahl’s most surreal writing and will capture your attention every step of the way.</p>
